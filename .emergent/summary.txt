<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website  under the brand name DryFruto.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Core App:** A full-stack web application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- **Branding:** Use the business name DryFruto and slogan Live With Health.
- **Functionality:** Product pages must have WhatsApp and Call buttons instead of a standard checkout.
- **Admin Panel:** A comprehensive admin panel is required to manage all website content, including UI elements, products, and site settings.
- **Feature Enhancements (added during sessions):**
    - The user has made numerous, often conflicting, requests regarding data management. This has resulted in several iterations of a seed data feature, culminating in a comprehensive import/export system with change history.
    - Deployment to Hostinger using Docker is a recurring but currently paused user goal.
    - Remove the Visit Us (address) section from the entire application.
    - Add a Save Changes button to the admin settings page.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) with a functional admin panel. A comprehensive data management system has been implemented, allowing the user to export all site data to a JSON file, import a JSON file to bulk-update content (including product price variations), and view a history of these changes.

The logic for initializing site data has been through multiple conflicting iterations (auto-seed on startup, hardcoded in endpoints, manual button) and now resides in a dedicated  file, triggered by a Seed Initial Data button in the admin panel.

The Docker deployment files for Hostinger have been updated to support SSL certificate generation from within the containers.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Adding a sticky Save Changes bar to the top of the admin settings page () for better user experience, and fixing button colors on that page.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0): Verify the new Save Changes sticky bar on the admin Settings page.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent used  to add a new sticky header component and fix incorrect CSS color classes in .
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Take a screenshot of the  page to visually confirm the new sticky bar and corrected button colors.
        2.  Perform a test save to ensure the UI changes did not break the existing save functionality.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To complete the user's request for an improved user experience on the settings page.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Future Task (P1):** Finalize and test the Docker deployment on Hostinger. The user has repeatedly requested this, and while the configuration files are updated (including SSL handling), the actual deployment has been a consistent source of issues.
-   **Refactoring (P2):** The  file has become a monolith containing models, API routes, and business logic. It should be broken down into a more maintainable structure (e.g., , , ).

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Data Management System (New Feature):**
    -   Created a Data Manager page in the admin panel.
    -   Implemented  to download all site data (products, categories, settings, etc.) as a single JSON file.
    -   Implemented  to upload a JSON file to bulk add/update data, including product price variations.
    -   Created a  collection and API to log all import/export actions, with a UI to view, refresh, and clear the history.
-   **Data Seeding Overhaul (Multiple Iterations):**
    -   Fixed idempotency issues to prevent duplicate data on repeated seeding.
    -   Iterated through multiple user-requested states: auto-seeding on startup, hardcoding data in GET endpoints, and finally settling on a manual Seed Initial Data button that uses a dedicated  file.
    -   The seed data was updated to match the data currently deployed in production.
-   **UI & Configuration Changes:**
    -   Removed the Visit Us address section from the website footer and the corresponding fields from the admin settings page and backend models.
    -   Re-added the Seed Initial Data button to the admin dashboard as per user request.
    -   Updated the frontend  to use  and npm <command>

-   **Deployment Fixes:**
    -   Added a  endpoint for Docker health checks.
    -   Updated  and  to support SSL certificate generation via environment variables, making the setup more robust for Hostinger.
    -   Added retry logic and startup dependencies to make the backend wait for the MongoDB container to be ready, fixing a common deployment race condition.

**All files of reference**
-   : The monolithic backend file, heavily modified to implement the data management system and various seeding strategies.
-   : Re-created to hold the production data for manual seeding.
-   : New frontend page for the data management system.
-   : Modified to add a sticky save bar and fix button styles.
-   : Modified multiple times to remove/add the Seed Initial Data button.
-   : Modified to remove the Visit Us section.
-    & : Modified to add routing for the new Data Manager page.
-   , , , : All updated to improve deployment stability and support for SSL.
-   : Updated with the latest deployment instructions.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-    is a monolith and is difficult to maintain. It should be broken down into separate modules for routes, models, and services to improve code organization and readability.

**key api endpoints**
-    (GET): Exports all site data as a JSON file.
-    (POST): Imports a JSON file to bulk-update site data.
-    (GET/DELETE): Manages the log of data changes.
-    (POST): Clears all collections and seeds the database with data from .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User changes mind frequently:** The user's behavior is highly iterative. They often request a feature, have it built, and then immediately ask for it to be changed or removed. The entire seed data saga is a testament to this. **ALWAYS confirm your plan with the user before executing any significant changes.**
-   **Data management is complex:** The application now has two ways to populate data: the Seed Initial Data button (a destructive reset) and the Import Data function (an upsert operation). Be clear about which system you are working on.
-   **Deployment is a recurring goal:** The user has paused their focus on deploying to Hostinger, but it is a recurring topic. The Docker files have been made more robust, but deployment itself remains untested in the latest configuration.
